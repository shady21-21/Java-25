Interface - > Blueprint of Class.
             Like, in interface written the blueprint how a extends class should be
             implement that.

* Interface only "abstract method" and "static constant"
* In abstract class both abstract method and regular method are there but
  in Interface only abstract method not regular.


* USE CASE OF INTERFACE :
  1> Archived "Multiple Inheritance".
  2> Abstraction.
